        <h2>Vanner Bush</h2>
        <h4>He was born on March 11 1890</h4>
        <p id="p1">American engineer, inventor, and science administrator who headed the United States Office of
            Scientific Research during World War II.
            Bush joined the Department of Electrical Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in
            1919 and founded the company that became the Raytheon Company in 1922.
            He is particularly known for his engineering work on analog computers and memex.
            One branch of the work done by Bush and others at MIT was the beginning of the theory of digital circuit
            design.
            Bush was appointed to the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics (NACA) in 1938 and soon became its
            chairman.As chairman of the National Defense Research Commission (NDRC) and later as director of the OSRD,
            Bush coordinated the activities of about six thousand leading American scientists in the field of applying
            science to warfare.
        </p>
        <p id="p2">Bush graduated from Chelsea High School in 1909.
            In 1917, after the United States entered World War I, he began working for the National Research Council.
            In 1922 he collaborated with MIT professor William H. Timbie on the introductory textbook Principles of
            Electrical Engineering.
            The new company's revenues soon exceeded one million dollars. In 1931, it merged with General Plate Company
            to form Metals & Controls Corporation, and in 1959 with Texas Instruments.
            In 1924, Bush and Marshall teamed up with physicist Charles G. Smith, who invented a voltage regulator tube
            called the S-tube.
            Beginning in 1927, Bush constructed a differential analyzer, an analog computer that could solve
            differential equations with up to 18 independent variables.
            Bush taught Boolean algebra, circuit theory, and calculus using the methods of Oliver Heaviside while Samuel
            Wesley Stratton was president of MIT.
            Bush introduced the concept of memex in the 1930s, which he envisioned as a form of memory augmentation with
            a microfilm-based "device" in which an individual stores all of his books, notes, and communications, and
            which is computerized and consulted with extraordinary speed and flexibility.
            From 1947 to 1962, Bush was a member of the board of directors of American Telephone and Telegraph.
        </p>
        <p>
            He retired as president of the Carnegie Institution and returned to Massachusetts in 1955, but remained a
            director of the Metals and Control Corporation from 1952 to 1959 and Merck & Co. from 1949 to 1962.
            After Bush suffered a stroke, he died on June 28, 1974, at the age of 84.
        </p>
