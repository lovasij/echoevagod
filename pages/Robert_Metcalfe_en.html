        <h2>Robert_Metcalfe</h2>
        <h4>He was born on April 7 1946</h4>
        <p id="p1">An American engineer and entrepreneur who contributed to the
            development of the internet in the 1970s. He was a partner in the invention of Ethernet, co-founder of 3Com,
            and formulated Metcalfe's Law, which describes the effect of telecommunications networks. Metcalfe made
            several predictions, including the demise of the internet in the 1990s, which did not come true.

            Metcalfe received numerous honors, including the IEEE Medal of Honor and the National Medal of Technology
            and Innovation for his work in developing Ethernet technology. In 2023, he received the Turing Award, the
            highest recognition in computing. From 2011 to 2021, he was a professor of innovation and entrepreneurship
            at the University of Texas at Austin. He was responsible for building some hardware at MAC that connected
            MIT minicomputers to ARPAnet. He identified and corrected some errors in the AlohaNet model and incorporated
            this work into his revised thesis, which he then submitted to Harvard and earned a PhD.
        </p>
        <p id="p2">In 1979, Metcalfe left PARC and co-founded 3Com, a company manufacturing computer networking
            equipment, in his Palo Alto home. 3Com became a leading provider of networking solutions, and Ethernet
            became the dominant networking standard for local area networks (LANs). In 1980, he received the ACM Grace
            Hopper Award for his contributions to the development of local area networks, especially Ethernet.

            In 1996, he co-founded the Pop!Tech leadership technology conference. In 2001, he became a venture
            capitalist and later a general partner at Polaris Venture Partners. In 2019, he delivered the Bernard Price
            Memorial Lecture in South Africa.
        </p>
        <p>
            In June 2022, Metcalfe returned to MIT, joining the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory
            as a research collaborator and computer engineer, collaborating with the MIT Julia Lab. He was inducted into
            the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2007 for his work on Ethernet technology. In 2008, he received the
            Fellow Award from the Computer History Museum for his fundamental contributions to the invention,
            standardization, and commercialization of Ethernet.
