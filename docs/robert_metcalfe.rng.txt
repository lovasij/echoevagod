He was born on April 7, 1946, an American engineer and entrepreneur who contributed to the development of the internet in the 1970s. He was a partner in the invention of Ethernet, co-founder of 3Com, and formulated Metcalfe's Law, which describes the effect of telecommunications networks. Metcalfe made several predictions, including the demise of the internet in the 1990s, which did not come true.

Metcalfe received numerous honors, including the IEEE Medal of Honor and the National Medal of Technology and Innovation for his work in developing Ethernet technology. In 2023, he received the Turing Award, the highest recognition in computing. From 2011 to 2021, he was a professor of innovation and entrepreneurship at the University of Texas at Austin. He was responsible for building some hardware at MAC that connected MIT minicomputers to ARPAnet. He identified and corrected some errors in the AlohaNet model and incorporated this work into his revised thesis, which he then submitted to Harvard and earned a PhD.

In 1979, Metcalfe left PARC and co-founded 3Com, a company manufacturing computer networking equipment, in his Palo Alto home. 3Com became a leading provider of networking solutions, and Ethernet became the dominant networking standard for local area networks (LANs). In 1980, he received the ACM Grace Hopper Award for his contributions to the development of local area networks, especially Ethernet.

In 1996, he co-founded the Pop!Tech leadership technology conference. In 2001, he became a venture capitalist and later a general partner at Polaris Venture Partners. In 2019, he delivered the Bernard Price Memorial Lecture in South Africa.

In June 2022, Metcalfe returned to MIT, joining the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory as a research collaborator and computer engineer, collaborating with the MIT Julia Lab. He was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2007 for his work on Ethernet technology. In 2008, he received the Fellow Award from the Computer History Museum for his fundamental contributions to the invention, standardization, and commercialization of Ethernet.
