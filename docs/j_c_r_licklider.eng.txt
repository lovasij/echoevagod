Born on March 11, 1915
Known simply as JCR or "Lick", he was an American psychologist and computer scientist who is considered one of the most prominent figures in the development of computing and the history of computing in general.
He is especially remembered because he was one of the first to foresee modern-style interactive computing and its application to all kinds of activities.
He did much to initiate this by funding research that led to major advances in computing, including today's canonical graphical user interface and ARPANET, the immediate predecessor of the Internet.
